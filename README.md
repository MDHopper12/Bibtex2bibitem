# Bibtex2bibitem
Although, there is a way to convert the BibTeX into bibitem, But sometimes I feel annoying to do while you are working on one style and mostly wil provide you some errors. Hence, this is a matlab code for generating bibitems from BibTeX cited by google scholar or others. 
Intructions about how to use the function.  
1. Save the BibTeX in text file and copy the path. (i.e. C:\Users\...\Desktop\BibTeX.txt)
2. Open matlab m-file as attached and run it, you will get error for the first time, but its okay. 
3. Insert the BibTeX file path into the function as the following:
   > bibtex2item("C:\Users\...\Desktop\BibTeX.txt") then hit enter â¬Ž
4. Have fun to use the same file for next reference.
