# Bibtex2bibitem
Although, there is a way to convert the BibTeX into bibitem, but sometimes I feel annoying to do while you are working on specific style and mostly wil provide you some errors that need troubleshooting which really affecting the focus and continuity of work. Hence, this Matlab code is ready to convert the bibitems from BibTeX cited by google scholar or others relavent formats. 
Intructions about how to use the function.  
1. Save the BibTeX in text file and copy the path. (i.e. C:\Users\...\Desktop\BibTeX.txt)
2. Open matlab m-file as attached and run it, you will get error for the first time, but its okay. 
3. Insert the BibTeX file path into the function as the following:
   > bibtex2item("C:\Users\...\Desktop\BibTeX.txt") then hit enter â¬Ž
4. Have fun to use the same file for next reference.
